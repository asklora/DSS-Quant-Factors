# SQL Tables
In [utils.sql.models](utils.sql.src.sql.models), we defined class diagram for quant_staging database (incomplete).

But this folder will store all newly added tables for sql read & write during research stage.

When moving from development/research -> production stage, we will also move finalized class diagram to [DSS-Quant-ML-Utils].
