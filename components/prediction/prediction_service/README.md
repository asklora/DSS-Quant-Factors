# Prediction Service
This steps use saved [/saved_model] and latest data for prediction and write results to DB.

In case where we only do prediction once right after retraining (e.g. DSS-Quant-AIvalue). This component is not applicable.

In other cases, prediction service will be scheduled separately from retaining.
