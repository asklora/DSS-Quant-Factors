# Data Validation
Read preprocessed data and perform pre-training test on data.

This step should make sure there is no skews in:
- data schema
- data value

This component will **only exist in research/deployment** stage. Therefore, no Dockerfile needed for this component. 


## Overview

## Research Documentation
This component should be supplemented with research documentation on why we eventually decide the current format of data preprocessing.
